## About Me

Hi, I’m Navin Kumar — a passionate graphic designer and creative thinker with a growing portfolio in digital design and web development. I specialize in turning ideas into visually engaging experiences through branding, photography, and clean design.

Currently building my skills in both traditional and digital media, I enjoy crafting designs that not only look great but also tell a story. Whether I’m designing business cards, building a personal brand, or creating a responsive website, I always aim to combine purpose with creativity.

I believe design has the power to inform, inspire, and influence — and I’m excited to continue exploring new tools, techniques, and trends in the digital world.

Let’s connect and create something impactful.
